# Lab 3


1. Data Cleaning(in Databricks)
- Dropped missing or invalid rows for `review_id`, `book_id`, and `user_id`
- Converted `rating` to integers between 1–5
- Trimmed text and removed short reviews (<10 characters)
- Deduplicated using `review_id`
- Joined with `books` and `authors` data
- Saved cleaned output to Delta table: **`curated_reviews`**

2. Data Curation
- Registered `curated_reviews` in Hive Metastore  
  `hive_metastore.default.curated_reviews`
- Verified schema and record count using SQL queries

3. Microsoft Fabric
- Created workspace `goodreads-ws-60314597`
- Connected to Azure Data Lake Gen2:
  `https://noorawitha.dfs.core.windows.net`
- Loaded curated Delta table from:
  `lakehouse/gold/curated_reviews/`
- Adjusted column data types (`review_id`, `book_id`, `user_id`, etc.)
- Handled missing values:
  - Removed blanks in `rating`
  - Replaced null `n_votes` with 0
  - Filled missing `language` with `"Unknown"`
- Trimmed text and standardized formatting (capitalized titles)
- Created derived aggregations:
  - Average rating per BookID
  - Number of reviews per BookID
  - Average rating per Author
  - Word count stats on `review_text`
- Published the final curated table back to Fabric
